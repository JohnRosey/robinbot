- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 8.9 or higher)

### Step 2) Install Robinbot

Run in your console,

```
git clone https://github.com/yura505/robinbot.git
```

Create your configuration file by copying `conf-sample.js` to `conf.js`:

```
cp conf-sample.js conf.js
```

- View and edit `conf.js`.
- You must add your Robinhood login/password and Quandl API key to configuration file for paper and live trading.
- For backtesting you have to provide only your Quandl API key to conf.js, no Robinhood credentials needed.
- Quandl API key can be free obtained from quandl.com

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Run a previous year backtest of default strategy

./backtest.js
```

```
./robinbot.js

After you've simulated, you can place real orders:

```
./robinbot.js --trade
```
